# German Traffic Sign Recognition Challenge using ResNets

This repository contains a simple, light and high accuracy model for the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark ([GTSRB](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)) dataset. This model was designed and trained for the [NYU's Fall 2018 Computer Vision course competition in Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nyu-cv-fall-2018). All training was done using GPUs in NYU's Prince cluster.

The baseline code for training and producing predictions was obtained [here](https://github.com/soumith/traffic-sign-detection-homework) and modified in this repository.

The Residual Network implemented in `model48.py` achieved 99.02% accuracy as a single model in the test set of GTSRB. Although not being the highest score of this dataset, this model can easily be trained in under 10 minutes in a single GPU. In its first epoch, it achieves already ~93% of accuracy in the validation set generated by `data48.py`.

(Please note: to proceed with training, please make sure you have PyTorch properly installed.)

#### Training the model:
1. First download the dataset from [GTSRB](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset)
2. Now run the following command:

```
python main48_cuda.py --data='<folder-with-data-zips>' --epochs=20 --batch-size=64 --lr=0.01 --wd=0.8 --momentum=0.9
```

3. The code saves the model after each training epoch and runs it through the validation set, where you can see the validation accuracy.

#### Generating Predictions:
1. After selecting the model you want to use, run the following command:

```
python evaluate48_cuda.py --data='<folder-with-data-zips>' --model=<chosen-model.pth>
```

2. This will produce the file `gtsrb_kaggle.csv`, which contains the predictions of your model.
